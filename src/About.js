      <br/>
      <p>I'm passionate about building applications that are minimal and have value for its users. I believe in the notion that less is more, and I think it’s a developer’s duty to make programs that are clear and effortless to use.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>JavaScript and React-Redux are my bread and butter, but I'm eager to take on projects that have me expanding my toolkit. I also love design and using CSS/Sass, responsive design, and animations to really make an app pop.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy any activity that gets me in the mountains. Much of my inspiration comes from there.</p>
